    "\n",
    "The basic CNN model seems to clearly be overfitting, but before we address that, we'll start by normalizing the input. This is a first step that is important for many ML models, but specifically for deep neural networks, as ReLU activations are only actually non-linear around an input of 0 (where the input switches from 0 to a linear output). This means that, for the ReLU activations to really be effective, you would want the average combined inputs to end up around 0, which is why *mean centering the data* is so important.\n",
    "\n",
    "You could use something like `np.mean` to compute the average input in all the training images and then subtract that average from every input, but the easiest way is to use the data preprocessor [ImageDataGenerator](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/preprocessing/image/ImageDataGenerator). To use this together with the `train_and_evaluate()` function, you'll need to use the optional `preprocess` argument, which is a [keyword argument dictionary](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-argument).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each key in the *keyword argument dictionary* should be a string of the keyword you want to pass to the function and the value in the dictionary should be the corresponding parameter value you want to pass to the function. In order to mean center the data, we want to enable `featurewise_center`, so that would look like\n",
    "\n",
    "    preprocess = {'featurewise_center': True}\n",
    "\n",
    "Use this keyword argument dictionary to enable mean centering the data as a preprocessing step. In addition, the training data should be normalized to have a standard deviation of 1, for which there is also a keyword argument. The `train_and_evaluate()` function will then apply these same preprocessing steps to both the training and the validation data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Start by copying the model from the cell before and then modify the `train_and_evaluate()` call to apply the mean centering and standard deviation normalization preprocessing to your data. If done correctly, your validation accuracy should increase to about *71%*.\n"

An important thing to note about the training cost here is that it may again become higher than the validation cost.

To get a better estimate of the true training cost, we would need to add a full evaluation of the training data at each epoch too, but then we'd effectively double the computation for training data at each epoch, making the algorithm much slower.

    "\n",
    "Now that the network is deeper, we might also benefit from applying batch normalization. With the preprocessing step at the start of this notebook the input features were normalized to have a 0 mean and standard deviation of 1, which helped the network learn mostly on the first layer with ReLU activations. With batch normalization this same type of scaling can be applied at each of the layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Start by copying the code from the previous cell and add a [BatchNormalization](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/BatchNormalization) layer after each MaxPooling layer. Effectively, this places the BatchNormalization layers *before* each of the layers with ReLU activations, except for the input layer (which has already been normalized). If done correctly, your validation accuracy should increase to about 84%.\n"
